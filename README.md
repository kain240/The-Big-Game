# The-Big-Game
This project is a real-time multiplayer game where players can create and join game rooms, interact with other players, and compete in a turn-based game. The system is designed to support multiple game rooms running simultaneously. It ensures smooth player experience through virtual identities, reconnection logic, and spectator mode.
